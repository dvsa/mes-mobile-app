    <h1 class="mes-header-lg">Check you have the right candidate</h1>

    <p class="mes-text-md">You must check each candidate’s details before you start the test.</p>
    
    <p class="mes-text-md">To view your candidate’s details, select their name from your journal. It will show you the candidate’s contact information, application reference number and driving licence number. </p>
    
    <h1 class="mes-header-lg">Sign the declarations</h1>
    
    <p class="mes-text-md">Once you have checked that the candidate’s details are correct, go back to your journal screen and select ‘start test’. Your candidate must sign to confirm they live in the UK and that their vehicle is insured. They can sign using their finger or the stylus pen. If the signature matches their provisional licence, select ‘confirm’. </p>
    
    <h1 class="mes-header-lg">Complete the pre-test</h1>
    <p class="mes-text-md">Before you start the practical test, you need to enter the pre-test results. This includes the eyesight test and ‘tell me’ question. You must also record the vehicle’s registration number, its transmission, who owns it and whether it has dual controls.</p>
    
    <h2 class="mes-header-lg">Eyesight test</h2>
    <p class="mes-text-md">To record the eyesight test result, you must select the ‘completed’ check box for a pass or ‘S’ for a fail. You must end the driving test if the candidate fails their eyesight test. </p>
    
    <h2 class="mes-header-lg">Tell me question</h2>
    <p class="mes-text-md">You can see the ‘tell me’ question for each candidate from your journal. You must give the result in the pre-test section by selecting the drop-down box. </p>
    
    <h2 class="mes-header-lg">Enter the registration number</h2>
    <p class="mes-text-md">Use the keyboard to enter the candidate’s vehicle registration number. </p>
     
    <h2 class="mes-header-lg">Give the vehicle’s transmission</h2>
    <p class="mes-text-md">Select ‘yes’ if the candidate’s vehicle is an automatic, or ‘no’ if the vehicle is a manual.  </p>
    
    <h2 class="mes-header-lg">Test observers</h2>
    <p class="mes-text-md">You need to record if anyone observes the candidate’s test. This can be an Approved Driving Instructor (ADI), a DVSA manager (Sup) or any other observer. </p>
    
    <p class="mes-text-md">If an ADI observes the test, you must enter their instructor registration number and certificate number too. </p>
    
    <p class="mes-text-md"> If no one observes the test, do not select an answer. </p>
    
    <p class="mes-text-md">When you have entered all of the pre-test information, select ‘confirm’.</p>
