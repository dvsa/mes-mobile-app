    <h1>Debrief Guidance</h1>

    <h2>Understand the information on the summary page</h2>
    
    <p>After the examiner presses ‘end test’ on the test report screen, the outcome of the test is reported on a summary screen. This summary includes whether the candidate has passed or failed, the test requirements and actions performed during the test, and a breakdown of the faults accrued by the candidate throughout the test.</p>
    
    <p>It is at this stage where the examiner has the opportunity to provide the candidate with a verbal debrief.  </p>
    
    <h2>Ending the debrief</h2>
    
    <p>To end the debrief, press ‘End Debrief’ on the test summary screen. The screens that are seen after the summary screen are dependent on the test outcome.</p>
    
    <h2>Fail outcome</h2>
    
    <p>In the event that the candidate has failed the test, once an examiner has finished the verbal debrief and pressed ‘end debrief’, they will be taken straight to the post-test details screen to record the number of the route taken, the ‘Show Me’ question asked, and weather conditions, among other details.</p>
    
    <h2>Pass outcome</h2>
    
    <p>In the event that the candidate has passed the test, once the examiner has pressed ‘end debrief’, they will be presented with the ‘pass finalisation’ page, which specifies the application reference number for the candidate, and asks whether the provisional license has been provided, and for the candidate’s pass certificate number. </p>
    
    <p>After the information on the pass finalisation page is provided, press ‘Continue’. This will take you to a health declaration that the passing candidate is required to sign. The candidate must first tap ‘I confirm’ to agree to the declaration and then provide their signature. </p>
